    <h3 class="head"> Hawaii Poke Bowl </h3>
    <img src="Poke.jpg" alt="Poke Bowl">
    <h4 class="rate"> My Rating: 10/10 </h4>
    <p class="text"> I love Hawaii Poke Bowl. Eel, spicy tuna, spicy salmon, and </br> 
        chicken are all good proteins. I also get cilantro, sweet corn, </br>
        cucumber, edamame, spicy crab salad, mango, pineapple, cilantro ranch, </br>
        house poke sauce, and sweet unagi sauce. </p> </div>

    <h3 class="head"> Chick N' Burger </h3>
    <img src="ChickN.jpg" alt="Chick N' Burger">
    <h4 class="rate"> My Rating: 9/10 </h4> 
    <p class="text"> Chick N' Burger is pretty good too. I usually get the </br> 
        crispy chicken burger and fries. The popcorn chicken is yummy as well </br>
        but I am not a huge fan of their bentos. I would recommend eating </br>
        their food right away so it does not lose its crisp. </p> </div>
    
    <div class="one">
    <h3 class="head"> Chipotle </h3>
    <img src="Chip.jpg" alt="Chipotle">
    <h4 class="rate"> My Rating: 8.5/10 </h4>
    <p class="text"> Chipotle is a classic that has been around for a while. </br> 
        You cannot go wrong with it, I like extra cheese and guacamole is </br>
        delicious except I am cheap and do not like paying extra. Chips </br>
        are also enjoyable, maybe too salty sometimes but still good. </p> </div>
